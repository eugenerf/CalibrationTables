# CalibrationTables
Developed for LLC KINEF.
Parces doc and docx files with standard calibration tables to text files. These text files can be used in Honeywell Experion PKS systems (can be read and processed with server scripts).
In application I've added some functionality to convert the level measurement units (in some systems level is measured in centimeters and in some in millimeters).
Also added the possibility to save calibration files in the format that can be read by the old OSSY stations (by Valcom).
With this application engineer can watch the calibration table, edit it, fix the most frequent errors in the tables.

Application is also interesting by the console menu developed specially for it and by the console watch and edit mode.

Code is fully documented in Russian.
